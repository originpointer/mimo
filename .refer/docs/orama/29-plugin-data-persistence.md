description: Persist your Orama database to disk or in-memory and restore it later.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `plugin-data-persistence` plugin allows you to persist your Orama database to disk or in-memory
and restore it later.

## Installation

You can install the plugin using any major Node.js/Bun package manager:

```bash
npm install @orama/plugin-data-persistence
```

## Usage

Plugin usage depends on the runtime that you are using, even though the goal is
to expose the exact same APIs for browsers, Deno, and all the other JavaScript
engines.

Let's consider the following Orama instance as a common database source for both
browsers and JavaScript engines:

```javascript copy
import { create, insert } from "@orama/orama";

const originalInstance = create({
schema: {
  author: "string",
  quote: "string",
},
});

insert(originalInstance, {
quote: "He who is brave is free",
author: "Seneca",
});

insert(originalInstance, {
quote: "Make each day your masterpiece",
author: "John Wooden",
});

insert(originalInstance, {
quote: "You must be the change you wish to see in the world",
author: "Mahatma Gandhi",
});
```

## Persisting the database to disk (in-memory usage)

Now we have a Orama instance containing three quotes. We can use the
`plugin-data-persistence` plugin to save the database to a file:

```javascript copy
import { persist } from "@orama/plugin-data-persistence";

const JSONIndex = await persist(originalInstance, "json");
```

## Restore the database from disk (in-memory usage)

To restore the database from an in-memory snapshot (created via the `persist` function):

```javascript copy
import { search } from "@orama/orama";
import { restore } from "@orama/plugin-data-persistence";

const newInstance = await restore("json", JSONIndex);

search(newInstance, {
term: "...",
});
```

## Persisting the database to disk (server usage)

<Callout type="warn">
The following methods are meant for server-side usage only and will throw an exception when used on browsers and runtimes without
a Node.js-compatible `fs` module.
</Callout>

Now we have a Orama instance containing three quotes. We can use the
`plugin-data-persistence` plugin to save the database to a file:

```javascript copy
import { persistToFile } from "@orama/plugin-data-persistence/server";

const filePath = await persistToFile(
originalInstance,
"binary",
"./quotes.msp"
);
```

## Restore the database from disk (server usage)

To restore the database from the disk:

```javascript copy
import { restoreFromFile } from "@orama/plugin-data-persistence/server";
const db = await restoreFromFile("binary", filePath);
```

# CommonJS Imports

Orama plugins ship **ESM** modules by default. This allows us to move faster when providing new features and bug fixes, as well as using the `"exports"` field in `package.json` to provide a better developer experience.

CommonJS imports are still supported, but we suggest you to migrate to ESM.

## TypeScript

Set `moduleResolution` in the `compilerOptions` in your `tsconfig.json` to be either `Node16` or `NodeNext`.

When importing types, always refer to the standard import:

```ts copy
import type { persistToFile } from "@orama/plugin-data-persistence";
```
